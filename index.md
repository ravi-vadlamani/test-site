Hey there! Thanks for stopping by.

My name is **Ravi**{: style="color: #3385D9;"}, _an undergraduate biology student_ who is passionate about microbiology and its applications to make the world a better place. I'm currently interested in research opportunities to expand horizons and find a niche.

My exceptional laboratory performance combined with a statistical analysis skill set are ideal for a company where a result oriented workflow is desirable. With experience in research & development as well as application in the industry, my workflow is quite adaptable and in-fact I enjoy a challenge that requires both technical and hands-on approach to find a solution.

Things I'm good at:
  -  Lab & Field skills: `UV/Vis Spectrophotometry` `PCR & Gel Electrophoresis` `Gas Chromatography (GC)`  `Cell Cultures` `Ecological Sampling` `Biomonitoring aquatic and terrestrial habitats`
  -  Programming: `C` `C++` `Python`

Things I'm learning:
  - `Statistical analysis in R` `LaTeX` `MATLAB modelling`

Fields of interest: 
  -  Application of Microbiology
  -  Viruses and Vaccines
  -  Environmental Biology and Sustainability
  -  Xenobiology
